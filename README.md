# AI-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world cloud environment and implements a Machine Learning-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python, Scapy, Snort, and Random Forest Classifier.

## Features
- Live packet capture and feature extraction
- Labeled malicious and normal traffic
- Machine learning model training and testing
- Real-time detection and alerting of cyberattacks

## Technologies
Python, Scapy, Snort, Scikit-learn, Linux Networking, VirtualBox.

## How to Run
1. Capture network traffic.
2. Train the ML model using captured data.
3. Deploy the real-time detection script.
